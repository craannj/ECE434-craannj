Etch-A-Sketch

After running the program the user is prompted for a height and width.
The formating works best with smaller boards but larger boards will function. 
The board is printed and the user is prompted to enter l,r,u,d,c or q and press enter.

l -> left
r -> right
u -> up
d -> down
c -> clear 
q -> quit

Each direction will cause an X to be left in the location the user picks. And clear will remove
all of the X's from the board. Quit will cause the program to stop running.
