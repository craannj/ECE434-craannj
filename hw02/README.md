Oscilloscope

1.  Max = 3.60V
	Min = -800mV

2.	Period = 240ms
	Frequency = 4.17Hz

3.  It is toggling after about 125ms 

4. There is a difference of about 25ms 

5. 19.0% of the processor is being used

6. The shortest period I could get was a period of 40ms

7. The period is not constant but stays between 40ms and 44ms

8. The period became less stable as the program launched but became stable again

9. Cleaning up the file results in a shorter period.

10. Using sh causes the period to be shorter.

11. 28ms is the shortest period gotten.

Python 

1.	Period = 160us
	Frequency = 6.25kHz

2. 100% of the processor is in use.
