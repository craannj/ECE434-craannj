Project - Connect 4

My project involves using an 8x8 led matrix with beaglebone to play Connect 4. The game will be able to be played directly using rotary encoders and buttons on the bread board. Additionally, the game will be able to be played through a web browser. Time permitting I would like to add an accelerometer for interactions such as clearing the board when the game is over.
